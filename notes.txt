if we create empty folder the git command cannot able to track it 
git only tracks the file 
so we make a gitkeep file through which it can be recognized

// Refrsh token and access token


-> refresh token 

    long lived -> 1day
    it compares the use refresh token and if the refresh token matches then it generates the access token

-> access token

    short lived -> 15 min

    example: authentication related stuff till that time without authentication


the main usage of access token and refresh token is that the user does not have to give their email and password again and again 

access token is short lived  due to which after the expiration of the acess token user need to reenter their email and password

refresh token are long lived and stored in the data base the refresh token stays with the user to and when the user tries just scroll something or other things which do not require authentication they can do all that stufff 

earlier only the access tokens were their but then google propose the tow token scheme in its research paper
